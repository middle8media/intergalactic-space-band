The adventures of a budding rock band and their eccentric robot manager as they tour intergalactic space.

The Intergalactic Space Band is an animated Adventure Comedy to be developed into twenty-two minute episodes, each consisting of two, eleven minute segments, and features original music performed by the band.

The story takes place both in California and in a variety of worlds and planets in the near future where technological advances have become commonplace. One such piece of technology is the BandBot, an advanced robot capable of successfully managing bands “to the stars and back.”

In the setting of Intergalactic Space Band, space travel is a way of life. Astrological and technological pursuits have brought space missions to the masses. Families, friends, and even bands can tour the cosmos, in their cars, trucks and vans which have been modified for celestial travel.

The Intergalactic Space Band runs into a slew misadventures while touring space in their Comet Unlimited. These comically sticky situations are overcome by the bands ingenuity and the meshing of their quirky personalities; not to mention the assistance of Manager 5000 BandBot.
